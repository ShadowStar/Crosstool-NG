# Not so simple case: Gentoo uses *two* wrappers around install script
# to deal with extended attributes:
#  - /usr/lib/portage/python*/ebuild-helpers/xattr/install
#    This sets __PORTAGE_HELPER_PATH (see the check above) and
#    invokes either C- or Python-based wrapper (they do the same
#    thing anyway). E.g., let it be /usr/bin/install-xattrs...
#  - /usr/bin/install-xattrs
#    This now analyzes $PATH and invokes 'install' in the first directory
#    in $PATH where it is found, but not the __PORTAGE_HELPER_PATH
# This scheme breaks if we interject another install wrapper, resulting
# in a fork bomb. Hence, if we detected a loop, we need to remove our
# own directory from $PATH and try again. Ironically, the very code below
# based on that portage helper.
