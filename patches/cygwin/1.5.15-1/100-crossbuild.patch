Hi Robert,

I've attached two patches:

1/  For crosstool-0.31 which changes the CYGWIN_URL to one which has the
cygwin source archives.  The version of cygwin that is used to build the
cross toolchain has been changed to cygwin-1.5.15-1-src.tar.bz2 since
most of the mirror sites don't seem to have the original archive used.
[created gcc-3.3.2-cygwin-1.5.15-1.dat - dank]


2/ The later cygwin source archive fails to cross build with the error:
/opt/crosstool/i686-pc-cygwin/gcc-3.3.2-cygwin-1.5.15-1/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-cygwin/bin/ld:
cannot find -luser32

unless the second patch is applied,
