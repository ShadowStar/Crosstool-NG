Raising the size of the hash table is a noticable win when linking 
at least one large app.  

There was a patch,
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2004-06/msg00165.html
to do this dynamically.  No idea why that didn't make it in.
So this tiny change to raise the default size is just
a stopgap for now.
