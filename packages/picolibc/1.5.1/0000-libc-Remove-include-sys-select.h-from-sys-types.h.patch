Subject: [PATCH 1/2] libc: Remove #include <sys/select.h> from sys/types.h

picolibc's sys/select.h is likely to be replaced by the underlying
operating system version (as it is on Zephyr). Don't include it from
sys/types.h as that version may depend on other definitions in
sys/types.h which haven't yet been defined.
