config LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR
    string
    prompt "Local tarballs directory" if ! BACKEND
    default "${HOME}/src"
    help
      If you have previously downloaded the tarballs, enter the PATH where
      you stored them here.

config SAVE_TARBALLS
    bool
    prompt "Save new tarballs" if ! BACKEND
    depends on LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR != "" || BACKEND
    default y
    help
      If you say 'y' here, new downloaded tarballs will be saved in the
      directory you entered above.

config WORK_DIR
    string
    prompt "Working directory" if ! BACKEND
    default "${CT_TOP_DIR}/.build"
    help
      Set this to the directory where all build actions will be done.
      
      The default is "${CT_TOP_DIR}/.build", and leaving this option
      empty will also use the default.
      
      You should not need to change that, except in one very peculiar
      setup:
       - your crosstool-NG source directory is on the network
       - you configured crosstool-NG with --local
      This kind of setup is a pain, as any action involving source file
      access would have to go through the wire. In this case, you should
      set CT_WORK_DIR to point to a path local to your machine, to avoid
      any network overhead.
      
      Do *NOT* change it if you don't know better.

config BUILD_TOP_DIR
    string
    default "${CT_WORK_DIR}/${CT_HOST:+HOST-${CT_HOST}/}${CT_TARGET}"

config PREFIX_DIR
    string
    prompt "Prefix directory" if ! BACKEND
    default "${CT_PREFIX:-${HOME}/x-tools}/${CT_HOST:+HOST-${CT_HOST}/}${CT_TARGET}"
    help
      This is the path the toolchain will run from.

config RM_RF_PREFIX_DIR
    bool
    prompt "|  Remove the prefix dir prior to building"
    default y
    depends on !BACKEND
    help
      If you say 'y' here, then PREFIX_DIR (above) will be eradicated
      prior to the toolchain is built.
      
      This can be useful when you are trying different settings (due
      to build failures or feature tests). In this case, to avoid using
      a potentially broken previous toolchain, the install location is
      removed, to start afresh.
      
      On the other hand, if you are building a final toolchain, and install
      it into a directory with pre-install, unrelated programs, it would be
      damageable to remove that directory. In this case, you may want to
      say 'n' here.
      
      Note that when acting as a backend, this option is not available, and
      is forced to 'n'.

config REMOVE_DOCS
    bool
    prompt "Remove documentation"
    default y
    help
      Remove the installed documentation (man and info pages).
      Gains around 8MiB for a uClibc-based, C and C++ compiler.

config BUILD_MANUALS
    bool
    prompt "Build the manuals"
    depends on ! REMOVE_DOCS
    help
      Build the PDF and HTML manuals for the main components such as
      binutils, GCC, GDB, and the C library.

config PREFIX_DIR_RO
    bool
    prompt "Render the toolchain read-only"
    default y
    help
      Render the directory of the toolchain (and its sub-directories)
      read-only.
      
      Useful for toolchains destined for production.

config STRIP_HOST_TOOLCHAIN_EXECUTABLES
    bool
    prompt "Strip host toolchain executables"
    default y
    help
      All build host executables contain a lot of unnecessary info.
      By stripping host executables it slightly speeds up the compilation
      of large projects.
      NOTE: It does NOT strip the target libraries, only HOST executables

config STRIP_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_EXECUTABLES
    bool
    prompt "Strip target toolchain executables"
    help
      It means using install-strip target for GCC 4.6 or later.
      An install-strip make target is provided that installs stripped
      executables, and may install libraries with unneeded or debugging
      sections stripped.
