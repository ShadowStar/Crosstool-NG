      Normally, crosstool-NG will try to download missing tarballs (or
      checkout from CVS/SVN...).
      If you do not have network connectivity when you run crosstool-NG,
      and some files are missing, it can be a long time before crosstool-NG
      fails.

      Saying 'y' here will prevent crosstool-NG from downloading missing
      files, thus failing early so that you don't get stuck.

if ! FORBID_DOWNLOAD

    prompt "Force downloads"
    help
      Force downloading tarballs, even if one already exists.

      Useful if you suspect a tarball to be damaged.

config CONNECT_TIMEOUT
    int
    prompt "Connection timeout"
    default 10
    help
      Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.

      The scenario is as follows;
        - some enterprise networks have firewalls that prohibit FTP traffic, while
          still allowing HTTP
        - most download sites have http:// equivalent for the ftp:// URL
        - after this number of seconds, it is considered that the connection could
          not be established, and the next URL in the list is tried, until we reach
          an URL that will go through the firewall, most probably an http:// URL.

      If you have a slow network, you'd better set this value higher than the default
      10s. If you know a firewall is blocking connections, but your network is globally
      fast, you can try to lower this value to jump more quickly to allowed URLs. YMMV.

      If '-1' is specified, no timeout reconfiguration options are passed to wget.

      Only download the tarballs. Exit once it done.
      
      Useful to pre-retrieve the tarballs before going off-line.

    bool
    prompt "Use a mirror"
    help
      If you have a machine on your LAN that mirrors some of the needed
      tarballs, you can say 'Y' here, and configure adequate values in
      the following options.
      
      Obviously, nothing prevents you from using a mirror that is in fact
      *not* on your LAN, for example on another subnet of your company's
      network, or a mirror on the Internet.

    help
      Only allow downloading from the mirror specified, other download locations
      will NOT be used, and the package will fail to be located if not present
      on the mirror provided

      This is the base URL searched in for tarballs.
      
      The crosstool-NG server hosts a few of the required components, but
      it is limited to volatile snashots (eg. uClibc) that are used in some
      samples, or to mirror some archives which upstream can be flaky (eg.
      mpfr), or for which upstream releases can be missing due to upstream
      not doing archives (eg. glibc-ports).
      
      The mirror is provided as-is, no guarantee is made as to the actual
      content of the archives, or to the availability of the mirror.
      
      Excercise caution, use at your own risks!
      
      The mirror is available at:
        http://crosstool-ng.org/mirrors/
