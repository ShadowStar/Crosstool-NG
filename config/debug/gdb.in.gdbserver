      In case you have trouble with dynamic loading of shared libraries,
      you will find that a static gdbserver comes in handy.

      However, it has been noticed at least on x86 that enabling this
      option produces an invalid gdbserver binary. It is linked with
      "-static -Wl,--dynamic-list=..." which
      # (a) requests invalid program interpreter
      # (b) crashes glibc/uClibc-ng and does not work with musl
      # See https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-03/msg00267.html

      It is possible it would work with other architectures, hence it is
      not completely removed. Use with care and report to the mailing list
      if the resulting gdbserver works.

      gdbserver >= 7.2 comes with an optional library to use tracepoints,
      the In Process Agent (IPA) library, libinproctrace.so.
      
      Say 'y' if you indend to use tracepoints when debugging your
      programs with gdbserver.
      
      Note: Currently, building this library is not possible when the
            gdbserver is built statically. This is a limitation in
            crosstool-NG, so do not bug upstream about it...
