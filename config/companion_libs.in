      It is highly recommended to check the newly built companion libraries.
      Unfortunately, this is a very intensive task, and takes a loooong time.
      
      Checking the newly built companion libraries is thus disabled by default,
      but it is suggested that you check them at least once on your machine,
      and if they work, disable the check on subsequent builds.
      
      If you suspect that one (or more) of your companion libraries is the
      cause for incorrectly generated code, you should answer 'Y' here.
      Note however that this will take a really long time. For example,
      building PPL on my machine takes roughly 1'40", while checking it takes
      about 1h40'...
